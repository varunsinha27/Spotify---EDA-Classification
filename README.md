# Spotify---EDA-Classification

The aim of this Jupyter Notebook file is to apply machine learning algorithm to a real dataset. The dataset comes from Spotify which captures various attributes about the songs and also include a popularity score. This project is further divided into 3 steps. First is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis, which will include the pre-liminary analysis of data, handling the missing values and visual analysis as well. The second part will be to perfrom Regression Machine Learning method which will aim to predict the popularity of a song and the last part will be a classification problem which will aim to predict the top genre of a song belongs to. The conclusion of the project will discuss the performance of the model in the Kaggle in-class competetion.
